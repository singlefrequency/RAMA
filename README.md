RAMA - RescAling n-body siMulAtions with neutrino

This python script uses reps (https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps) output to derive sigma(R) for original and 
target cosmologies assuming massive neutrino background as a target cosmology. For more information regarding 
rescaling procedure, please refer to the paper https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz2612.
